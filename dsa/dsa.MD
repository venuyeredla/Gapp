## DSA is Time/Space complexity

Brute Force method. Also know as exhaustive search or generate-and-test. By using below alpatterns or data strutures write algorithm can be written.

## Algorithm Design patterns 
1. Array 
	Soring & Binary search.
	Single pointer with beginning either at left or right.
	Rearrangement - Partioning(Quick sort),  Swapping

2. Two pointer
	 Two ends, Sequential.
	 Two arrays comparison or merging
	 Predominantly for pairs, duplicate removal, non repeating.
	 Instead of deleting an element consider rewriting using two pointer approach.

3. Sliding window 
	Max/Min sum sub array problems

4. Hashing
	Hash function.  h(x) => {x /n |  maps to index of hash table}
	Occurrence (counting), Look up or membership queries can be tackled with Hashing.
	Hash table (array of size n) - Value is linked list items with same hash value (Chaining ). (Open addressing) 

5. Recursion
	An algorithm is called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing in to instance smaller input same function. Many useful algorithms are recursive in nature. Code can be written succinctly.  Strings, Tree problems are recursive problems.

	Use recursion if outcome of current step computation is being added to next instance of the problem. If not we can use simple iteration. In recursion final result is achieved by caching the result in method stack. Whereas in iteration temporary / intermediary variables are used.

	1. Head recursion,
	2. Tail recursion (This can be easily replaced with iteration)
	3. Top down
	4. Bottom up
	5 Caching.
	6. Precomputing and using these smaller solutions to build bigger solutions.
	
	f (n) = n   (+,*, -)  f(n-1)
 	Edit distance :     d = 1 + Max(delete, insert, update)


	Subset problems
	Permuation

6. Back tracking 
	Combinations or permutations problems can be solved with this approach. It’s a systematic way to iterate through all the possible configurations of a search space exactly once. Use extra memory to record visiting of configuration.

	Exploring the vertices of a graph via depth-first search, also known as backtracking,

Decision, Optimization, Enumeration problems can be solved with this approach.	2. problem - Searching for best solution.



7. Divide and Conquer
	(Non overlapping or disjoint subproblems)
	Divide -> Conquer -> Combine.
  	Merge Sort and Quick sort.

8. Dynamic programming
	See for problems of Counting, Minimum, Maximum, Longest or shortest.

	When problem being solved using recursion and if there are overlapping subproblems, then it is time to consider Dynamic programming. Below are the approaches
	1. Top-down with memoization =>  Recursion + Cache
	2.  Bottom-up Built up the sub problems to combine to final solution. Solves the each sub-problem once then save the result into a table (1D, 2D)
	Time - Memory trade off

9. Greedy
	Compute solution in stages, making choices that are locally optimum at step. These choices are never undone. Greedy algorithms provide solutions for optimization problems. This algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. This locally optimal choice leads to a global optimal solution.

	Min/Max products subsets
	
	Elements of Greedy algorithms
	1. Determine optimal substructure of the problem.
	2. Develop a recursive solution 
	3. Show that if you make greedy choice then only one sub problem remains. 
	4. Prove that it is always safe to make a greedy choice. 
	5. Develop a recursive algorithm that implements greedy strategy. 
	6. Convert the recursive algorithm to an iterative algorithm. 

 Ex. 	1. Finding a shortest path between two cities with small mileage.
	2. Encoding a messing with fewer number of bit. Ex. Huffman coding.	
	3. Choosing denominations - Change making algorithm.
	4. Activity selection problem.
	5. Minimum spanning trees. 
	6. Offline-caching.


## Data structures
1. Min, Max or Kth min/max Heaps /prioity queues. (Treap)
2. Range sum queries :  Prfix sum, Segment tree (Full binary trees), Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)
3. Text pattern matching or keyword lookup
	Trie or Prefix tree - Useful for key look up and prefix queries.
	Suffix Tree & Suffix array. - Useful for implementing pattern matching queries.
	Effective implementation of text indexing : Finite state automata & Finite state transducer.

Fundamental abstract types. 
1. Containers : List, Set
2. Dictionaries : 
   		Hash Table, BST, SkipLists
		Disk based ( BTree & B+Tree, SSTables, LSM tress)
3. Priority queues (Heaps)
	Complete Binary Trees(CBT)

4. Retrieval based structures.
	Stack / LIFO  (DFS, Recursion replacement)
	Queue /  FIFO  (Uses in DFS)

5. Membership queries : Sets, Bitset, Bloom filters.


## Advanced Data structures
	XOR List, Skip List, Self organized list.

	Non-linear : Binary Tree (Complete, Full, Perfect). Lever order insertion/traversal.
			 BST (AVL tree, RED-Black Tree. Splay Tree)

# Matrix 
Multi dimensional arrays
2d,
Multiplication,Rotation etc...

# Geometry
	Points, Polygons, KD-Tree.



## Order of growth or rate of growth.

Omega <=   f(x). <=  Big O
Theta  - Characterizes the lower and upper bounds.

Counting rules.
	1.  Each simple operation (+, *, –, =, if, call) takes exactly one time step. 	
    2.  Loops and subroutines are O(n). 
	3. Each memory access takes exactly one time step.




## Problem Analysis patterns.

Until problem is understood thoroughly and written down approaches don’t jump on to code.

Read through problem, if it is feasible try to formulate expression or equation with boundary conditions.
	Ex :
	Triplet sum. x+y+z=sum. 	i>-1 or i<n
	 Largest difference in array =MaxNum-MinNum, smallest.
	Max(s[i-j], S[j:k])
	Sum of the first numbers (n*(n+1))/2

	Problems with count, min or max (optimization problems), shortest, longest words means that there several solutions/options for getting an output. These kind of problems are categorized as optimization problems. The objective here is to minimizes or maximizes the value of some parameter. Primarily involves recursion, so tries to break down the problem into smaller inputs of the same function.

   Min(f(x)) &  Max(f(x))

2.  Picturize the problem and identify problem type. Model the problem mathematically with variables.

	Majority of the algorithms designed to work on rigorously defined abstract structures such as permutations, combinations, graphs, and sets. To exploit the algorithms literature, you must learn to describe your problem abstractly, in terms of procedures on fundamental structures.

	1. Permutations and combinations. (Counting)
	2. Subsets or Subarrays. (Summations). (Interval problem)
	3. Trees
	4. Graphs 
	5. Points
	6. Polygons
	7. Strings.

3.	Jot down combinations of problem inputs with different use cases ( as test cases ).
	Edit distance 
	S1:  “”	,”abac”
	S2:  “abac”,    “” 
	
	What if input is empty?
	What is the starting point and endpoint?
	If there are multiple data points what do you do at each step?

Concrete example : Manually solve concrete instances of the problem and then build general solution.
Case analysis : Split input into multiple cases and solve each in isolation.
Iterative refinement : Most problems can be solved used Brute-force approach. Find that solution and improve upon it.
Reduction :  Use well-known solution to some other problem as a sub routine.
Graph modeling : Describe the problem using graph and solve it using existing algorithm.
