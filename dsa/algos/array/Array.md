# Array Notes

1. Soring & Binary search.
2. Merging if arrays size> 1 and sorted.
3. Two pointer approach
4  Sliding 
5. Recursion


1. Rewriting array and using two pointer approach. Instead of deleting consider rewriting.
2. Partioning(Quick sort), Sorting, Searching, Swapping, Rearrangement.
3. Array problems has brute force approach.

# Problem types.
1. Search for key
2. Kth Min and max elements. (Partial sorting or Heaps/priority queues are best)
3. Sub array :
      Max/Min sum sub array problems
      Kth min & max sum sub array (Using heaps)

4. Subset problems : Min/Max products subsets (Using greedy.)

4. Range sum queries.
   Datastructures : Prfix sum array, Heaps and segment trees, Binary indexed Tree.
5. Sum problems 
    x+y= Z, x+y+z=k

#Standard problems
1. Even entries appears first.
2. Partitionng array
   about a pivot element, as even and odd. Positiv/negative, zero/nonzero, 
3. Delete duplicates from sorted array.
4. Buy and sell stocks and made profit.
   Once 
   Twice.
5. Sub array - Maxsum, entries are equal. 
6. Compute next permutation, kth permutation, previous permuation,random permutation
7. Sample offline data.

Multi dimensional arrays
2d,

Multiplication,Rotation etc...
