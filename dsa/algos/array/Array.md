# Array Notes
Array: Partioning(Quick sort), Sorting, Searching, Swapping, Rearrangement.

Search for key
Kth Min and max elements. (Complete sorting is not needed. So Heaps/priority queues are best)

Range sum queries.
Datastructures : Prfix sum array, Heaps and segment trees, Binary indexed Tree.

Equal to a value pair.

Sub array :
Max/Min sum sub array problems
Kth min & max sum sub array (Using heaps)

Subset problems
Min/Max products subsets (Using greedy.)

Notes: 
1. Array problems has brute force approach.
2. Instead of deleting consider rewriting.

#Standard problems
1. Even entries appears first.
2. Partitionng array
   about a pivot element, as even and odd. Positiv/negative, zero/nonzero, 
3. Delete duplicates from sorted array.
4. Buy and sell stocks and made profit.
   Once 
   Twice.
5. Sub array - Maxsum, entries are equal. 
6. Compute next permutation, kth permutation, previous permuation,random permutation
7. Sample offline data.

Multi dimensional arrays
2d,

Multiplication,Rotation etc...
